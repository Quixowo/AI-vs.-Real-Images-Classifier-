## Project Overview
With the rapid rise of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models (like Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion), distinguishing between authentic photography and synthetic media has become a critical challenge for information integrity.

This project addresses this problem by building a **binary classification model** capable of detecting AI-generated artifacts. By leveraging **Transfer Learning** on the **MobileNetV3** architecture, the solution achieves high accuracy while remaining lightweight enough for edge deployment (e.g., mobile apps or browser plugins).

## Key Features
* **Transfer Learning:** Utilizes pre-trained weights from ImageNet to accelerate convergence.
* **Lightweight Architecture:** MobileNetV3Small/Large ensures low latency inference.
* **Data Augmentation:** Robust preprocessing pipeline (rotations, zooms, flips) to prevent overfitting.

## Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python, NumPy, Pandas
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow/Keras
* **Base Model:** MobileNetV3 (Pre-trained on ImageNet)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib
* **Environment:** Google Colab

## Dataset
The model was trained on the **[AI vs Human Generated Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrasala79/ai-vs-human-generated-dataset)** sourced from Kaggle.
* **Total Images:** [80,000 (60,000 training and 20,000 validation)]
* **Split:** [e.g., 50% Real / 50% AI-Generated]
* **Resolution:** Resized to [e.g., 224x224] for MobileNetV3 input.

## Results
The model achieves exceptional performance, making it suitable for real-world screening applications.
